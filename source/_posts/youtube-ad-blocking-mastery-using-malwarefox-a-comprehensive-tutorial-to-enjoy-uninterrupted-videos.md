## Remove ads on YouTube by Downloading Videos

It is possible to download videos from YouTube on to your computer for easy offline viewing at any time or place. You can download YouTube videos using third-party websites such as Clip Grab.

The format is as follows –  https://www.ssyoutube.com However, sometimes you may have too many videos to view that consume so much time to download and some much more data. Thus, downloading your videos may not be the best option to avoid YouTube Ads.

YouTube Red offers a paid- premium membership use of the platform. With YouTube Red, the user gets uninterrupted (ad-free) and improved use of the platform. The user also gets access to YouTube Music and Gaming. Pricing for YouTube Red ranges according to the host country, with some users paying up to US$9.99\. The limitation of this improved use of the platform is that it is not yet available in many countries. YouTube Red only works in the USA, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Mexico.

## Watch YouTube without Ads

If you are good with technology, this is also an option to consider. However, this option may not be ideal for all due to its ethical implications. You can simply do block Ads by copying the URL of the video you want to stream, and then open pages like [Adless Tube](https://youtubenoad.com/) or [ViewPure](http://www.viewpure.com/), and copy the video URL into their search space.

## Remove YouTube Ads From Your Content

As a content creator for your videos, you can choose whether you want Ads for your viewers or not. It all depends on what you want to showcase and to what extent you want to use the YouTube platform. If for example, you want to monetize your content and earn extra cash, you probably will want to allow Ads to your content so you can get paid. However, if you don’t want to monetize your content, the best bet is to remove Ads so that you can optimize your viewers’ experience. Simply follow the steps below to remove Ads from your content:
1. Click on your profile picture at the top right corner of your screen
2. Go the “Creator Studio”, go to the menu on the left and click on the “channel” option
3. On the “Channel option’s drop menu, pick the “Advanced” menu
4. Uncheck the “Allow Advertisements To Be Displayed Alongside My Videos” box

## Other Possibilities

YouTube partner programs such as AdSense lets the viewer filter through Ads powered by them when you are streaming YouTube videos and channels. Simply log into AdSense, go to the “Allow and Block Ads” tab and click on the top-left drop-down menu. Then, click on “Blocking Controls” then choose “YouTube Host”. The pages give you two blocking options – you can either block specific advertisement URLS or generally block all AdSense powered Advertisements. To block specific advertisements, click on the “Advertiser URLs” tab at the top f the page, enter the Url in the space provided then click on “Block URLs”. To block all advertisements, pick the categories on the same page. The added changes are then automatically saved and reflect on YouTube streaming in 24 hours. This option is limited because it will only block Ads powered under AdSense thus; other Ads will still freely pop up in your YouTube streaming experience.
