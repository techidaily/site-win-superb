## Remove ads on YouTube by Downloading Videos

It is possible to download videos from YouTube on to your computer for easy offline viewing at any time or place. You can download YouTube videos using third-party websites such as Clip Grab. And if this process gets a little too cumbersome or confusing for you, adding **ss** into the video’s URL lets you download the videos directly from YouTube. The format is as follows –  https://www.ssyoutube.com However, sometimes you may have too many videos to view that consume so much time to download and some much more data. Thus, downloading your videos may not be the best option to avoid YouTube Ads.

## Subscribe to YouTube Red and Get rid of Ads

YouTube Red offers a paid- premium membership use of the platform. With YouTube Red, the user gets uninterrupted (ad-free) and improved use of the platform. The user also gets access to YouTube Music and Gaming. Pricing for YouTube Red ranges according to the host country, with some users paying up to US$9.99\.

## Watch YouTube without Ads

If you are good with technology, this is also an option to consider. However, this option may not be ideal for all due to its ethical implications. You can simply do block Ads by copying the URL of the video you want to stream, and then open pages like [Adless Tube](https://youtubenoad.com/) or [ViewPure](http://www.viewpure.com/), and copy the video URL into their search space. These Ad blocking pages work by removing the Ad for the video URL thus, letting you stream them without clutter.
