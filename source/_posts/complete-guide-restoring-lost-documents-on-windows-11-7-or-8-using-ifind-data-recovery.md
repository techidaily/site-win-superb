### **2\. How to Restore Deleted Files With Previous Versions Tabs in Windows PCs?**

Microsoft added it from Windows XP and made lots of improvements in the following Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, Windows 10, and Windows 11\. There are some differences listed.

| Windows 11/10 | Windows 10 brings the “Previous Versions” tab back from Win8, but Microsoft rebuilds it on a whole new function called “File History” now in place of the old “Volume Shadow copy”. Windows 11 is also the same. |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 8     | The shadow copies function is still there, but the “Previous versions” tab was removed, nonetheless, you can still use the 3-part tools to retrieve.                                                             |
| Windows 7     | Windows system will automatically build a shadow copy (as a restore point) daily, or manually. The function called “Previous Versions” is also added in Win7                                                     |
