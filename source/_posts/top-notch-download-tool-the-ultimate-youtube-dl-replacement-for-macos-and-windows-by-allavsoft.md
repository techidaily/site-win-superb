Youtube-dl is a command-line software to help users to download videos from YouTube and other websites. But many Youtube-dl users are posting threads in Google forum for complaining Youtube-dl issues and also asking for Youtube-dl alternatives. See some Youtube-dl issues I collected in Google forums:

* I find that Youtube-dl only supports to download videos in limited output formats, how can I download the video to the specific video format that Youtube-dl does not support?
* Can you add one anime video website as your supported site? My kid likes to watch anime videos on this anime website, but this anime site is not supported by Youtube-dl.
* Why Youtube-dl can not download some videos from its supported video site? I tried three times, but all failed.
