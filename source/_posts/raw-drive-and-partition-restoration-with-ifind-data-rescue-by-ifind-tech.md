## What causes the RAW Drive and RAW Partition?

There are many reasons for the problems, but they fall broadly into two categories: misuse and software failure.

1: No normal plug and unplug storage device, which will lead to equipment failure and even system failure.

2: Incomplete read / write operations, such as shutting down or suddenly losing power while copying files to the device. This could cause a failure the next time the device is turned on.

3: Choose inferior hardware product, include an inferior power source, motherboard, data line, especially inferior external hard disk box. This can lead to unstable power supplies or unstable master chips, which can lead to memory addressing errors, writing dislocations, and file system mutations.

4: Disk partition adjustment tools such as PQ, PM (PowerQuest PartitionMagic) are used, which claim to support Windows XP 7/10 but are somewhat risky. There may be problems with the device’s programs not running, the device not being able to open or even file system errors (including mutant RAW). I recommend that you use Windows’s own partition management tools.

## 3: HOW To Recover RAW Drive/Partition/USB/SD Card

Some people think I should format the drive at first, then using some software to [recover your hard drive](https://www.ifind-recovery.com/how-to/how-to-recover-a-hard-drive/).

> NOTICE: It may be useful in some situations, but we do NOT recommend you Format the drive all the time.

Because after formatting, especially for FAT/FAT32 partition, the data directory structure CAN NOT restore completely. Especially the critical files that are often repeatedly edited. As there are many file fragments, the recovery software loses the comparison analysis of FAT table, So recovered files can’t be opened.

Please be careful when you are doing:

* **USB raw format**
* **Raw disk format**
* **Sd card Raw format**

[iFinD Data Recovery](https://www.ifind-recovery.com) Software is our recommendation. It‘s a powerful and easy-to-use data recovery software, your best choice for performing the raw partition recovery or raw drive recovery.
