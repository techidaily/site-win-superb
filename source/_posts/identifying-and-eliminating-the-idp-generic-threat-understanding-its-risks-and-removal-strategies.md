For the people who use security solutions like Avast or AVG, “**IDP.Generic”** might be a familiar term. This term is not limited to a single malware program. It is, in fact, a generic term used by antimalware solutions for naming **identity theft** programs. IDP stands for **Identity Detection Protection**.

Whenever a security solution pop-ups the “IDP.Generic” pop-up, it indicates that the antimalware program has detected an unusual behavioral pattern. That is, the cybercriminals made an attempt to steal your personal information.

However, many times an antimalware show a false-positive result because it is outdated or broken. A false-positive result means that antimalware would catch the program or files that are not actually malware. As a result, it reports many legitimate programs such as gaming platform steam, discord, and others as malicious. 

Because of the repetitive false-positive detection, people tend to ignore the “IDP.Generic” threat. This is where cybercriminals take advantage. They release and bypass the malicious files by naming them similar to legit files. Most users ignore the warnings from the security solution, thinking them as a false-positive. 

It is a best practice to check the files thoroughly before you mark them safe.

In this guide, we would discuss more about IDP.Generic virus and how to remove it from your system.

## What are the symptoms of the IDP.Generic virus?

Since it is not a single malware, but a [variety of malware programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) such as trojans, banking malware, info-stealers, malware droppers, rootkits, and other types, it isn’t easy to detect the IDP.Generic virus symptoms.

However, some common symptoms are:

* CPU usage suddenly raises then usual.
* The system lags frequently.
* Your browser is bombarded with malicious pop-ups.

* Redirection to untrustworthy or suspicious sites.

## How does the IDP.Generic virus works?

If the warning by antimalware is not a false-positive, then IDP.Generic virus detection means your system is generally infected with a Trojan virus. A trojan virus presents itself as a legitimate app or file and works in the background by corrupting your data to intercept your internet traffic. Developers can use it to perform many malicious activities like stealing your bank information, passwords, spying on your mails, and more.
