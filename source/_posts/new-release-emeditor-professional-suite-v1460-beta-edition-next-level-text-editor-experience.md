Today, we are releasing EmEditor Professional v14.6.0 beta 17.  
Updates from v14.6.0 beta 16 include:  
   * The **Prefer UTF-8** check box was added to the File tab of configuration properties. When this is checked and the **Detect UTF-8** check box is also checked, UTF-8 takes precedence if the file can be interpreted both as UTF-8 and the selected encoding. For example, a file contains only ANSI characters (alphabets and numbers), it can be opened without any problems both as UTF-8 and Western European. In this situation, EmEditor opens the file as UTF-8\. EmEditor also opens an empty file as UTF-8 if this is checked.  
   * Stability improvements.

Hello Yutaka,  
The progessbar in dialog “Sorting” is not equal to the progress in numbers, e.g.:  
 Sorting (2/3)  
 29 / 125  
 Progressbar shows 41%.  
I’ve never seen (in many sortings) that the progressbar reaches 100%.  
Thanks in advance!

Feature request:  
Hello Yutaka,  
Every day I do a lot of Find- and Replace actions with big logfiles.  
Could you please have a look at:  
 – creating favorites (so, Find- and Replacestring which will be saved under a logic name) (please have a look at UltraEdit)  
 – increasing the historie to (lets say) 128 items? or perhaps more?  
Thanks in advance,

Hello Rien van Ham,  
I believe the progress bar is correct, but the last step (3/3) finishes immediately. It makes difference when you sort even larger files.  
I will think about your search feature requests in the future. You might want to use macros to define several searches, and you can just run those macros. You can also define “markers” on the Marker toolbar, and pressing a marker button will search the string.  
Thanks,

Hello Yutaka,  
Again I missed something or I have a feature request:  
In my sourcecode (yes, I’m also a developer) very often I’m putting in comments with EmEditor. A handy feature are the snippets, but with the time and date objects I’m missing a format method.  
It would be very nice if I could use (e.g.) ${Date.format(“dd-mm-yyyy”)} or ${Time.format(“hh:mm:ss”)} (like the .net format method so it writes the date and timestrings in my own format, and not the format of Windows.  
Thanks again!

Since EmEditor v14.6.0 beta 18 (when “Macros: The eeFindExtract and eeFindReplaceSelOnly flags were added to the Find method” was added) the Find Toolbar & Find do not work. It will Count the number of Search Instances. However it will not go to the Next Instance, plus the Find Previous & Find Next do not work.

With the “Find Extract All” Method it Copies the whole Line where the Search Term was found – which is good for some instances.  
However in some instances it would be good to just copy each Search Instance on to a New Line.  
For example to Find the Date (in the follow text) when written in the Day-Month-Year Format via RegEx is “\[0-9\].\*?2014″:  
 ”  
 On the 1 June 2014 travelled to Australia.  
 On the 2 June 2014 travelled to New Zealand.  
 ”  
Using the RegEx “\[0-9\].\*?2014” and pressing “Extract All” will just return the original Text (i.e. each line that contains the Search Term):  
 ”  
 On the 1 June 2014 travelled to Australia.  
 On the 2 June 2014 travelled to New Zealand.  
 ”  
Using the RegEx “\[0-9\].\*?2014” and pressing “Find All” => then Copy all Found Matches, and Pasting the results into a New Text Document – will put all the Search Results on to the 1 Line:  
 ”  
 1 June 20142 June 2014  
 ”  
Hence it would be good to have a Method to Extract All to just Extract each Search Result to a New Line e.g.  
 ”  
 1 June 2014  
 2 June 2014

Hello Pangius,  
Actually, after you make multiple selections, click the Edit menu -> Selection Mode -> Sticky Vertical Mode, and copy. You will find all the strings are separated by new lines.  
I will try to add an option to make this clearer in the future.  
Thank you,
